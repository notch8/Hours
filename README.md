Hours is a dead simple project based time tracking application that we use
for internal time-tracking. It allows users to register how many hours they've
worked on a project with a certain category (think `design`, `software development`,
`testing` for software teams) and add any tag they like to it. This gives us a lot of
insight on how we spend our time on different projects.

It looks like this:

Roadmap
-------

As we're using Hours we're constantly thinking of ways to improve it and we'd love to hear your thoughts!

System Dependencies
-------------------

- Ruby 2.4.2 (install with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv))
- Rubygems
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
- PostgreSQL
- qmake (`brew install qt`) or read extensive instructions [here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit)
- memcached (`brew install memcached`, an older version ships with OSX)(optional)

Getting Started
---------------

Install Docker.app

Make sure PostgreSQL is also installed on your computer 

$git branch pull origin Notch8_deploy

$gem install stack_car 

$gem install dotenv 

Ensure that there is .env file, if not reach out to a team member for the copy of the file

$sc up 

Create a database.yml file. Then copy and paste the content from the database.yml.example into the database.yml file

$sc be rake db:create db:schema:load db:migrate db:seed

After successful seed migration, go to http://testinstance.lvh.me:3000


Feature Flags
-------------

Description:

Single Tenant Mode: Initialize application in single tenant mode. Disabled by default.

Usage:

To use the single tenant mode, you can add SINGLE_TENANT_MODE to your enviroment variables with the value `true`. On development you can set this in your .env with `SINGLE_TENANT_MODE=true` and restart foreman. On heroku it's under the `Config Variables`.
The first user in single tenant mode can be created by a rake task `rake create_user`. We'll ask you for your credentials.

Guidelines
----------
- Pull requests are welcome! If you aren't able to contribute code please open an issue on Github.
- Write specs!
- Develop features on dedicated feature branches, feel free to open a PR while it's still WIP
- Please adhere to the [Thoughtbot ruby styleguide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style#ruby)
- All code and commit messages should be in English
- Commit messages are written in the imperative with a short, descriptive title. Good => `Return a 204 when updating a question`, bad => `Changed http response` or `I updated the http response on the update action in the QuestionController because we're not showing any data there`. The first line should always be 50 characters or less and that it should be followed by a blank line.
- Please localize all strings and add i18n keys to the locale files sorted by key in ascending order
